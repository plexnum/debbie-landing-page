                                <p>
                                    Hello, my name is Debbie Millmann.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    It’s not something new what’s happened to me – I don’t pretend my story is unique.
                                    There are many educated, accomplished, high-achieving, and almost flawless women... but not married.
                                    And, not because they don’t want – they can’t find a match!
                                    I can remember my parents always lived in perfect harmony, and I wished the same for myself, but no such luck.
                                    I was 20, 25, 30 but still alone.
                                    Reading on Facebook that another classmate or friend from university has got married and is being happy I felt defeated: all my friends enjoy their marriage wholeheartedly but I’m not.
                                </p>

                                <p>So, I was alone. I attended several psychological workshops where I was taught how to find the right partner.
                                    I practiced meditation, repeated affirmations, and even tried hypnosis.
                                    I did everything to be happy but had not succeeded.
                                    At night, I often imagined a husband next to me staring at me with his eyes full of adoration.
                                    Or, there we are sitting in front of a fireplace and enjoying each other's company.
                                    And, of course, we have children.
                                    And, spending vacations together, studying together, love story photo shooting, family lunches, dinners, and holidays.
                                    How magical all that is!
                                </p>

                                <p>Nothing could help, and I got nuts about psychology.
                                    After reading a ton of books, I realized that I have to start from changing myself and loving myself, for only by loving yourself as you are and giving love to this world, you can be in harmony and attract real love into your life. </p>

                                <p>I was studying different “how-to” materials, when, accidentally, I stumbled across one <a href="https://21dollarstore.com/pages/magical-pendant-landing-page">website.</a></p>


                                <div class="wp-caption full-width">
                                    <img src="img/photo2.jpg" alt="">
                                </div>

                                <p>
                                    It did not promise to find a mate quickly for being happy and did not teach understanding a partner at a glance – nope!
                                    But there I have found more: it was a pendant that emblemized love, with the words “I love you” in 100 languages on it.
                                    It was exactly what I needed at the moment.
                                    The pendant seemed was carrying some secret meaning, and, as soon as I got it, something had been changed in me, and I had become more self-confident.
                                    I had begun to love myself more as if I was pushed by it. And, looking ahead, it had become my talisman.
                                </p>

                                <div class="wp-caption full-width">
                                    <img src="img/photo3.jpg" alt="">
                                </div>

                                <p>
                                    One day, I was sitting at the cafe and reading a book on psychology.
                                    After a while, I put it aside and fell into the dreams about who will be by my side in my old age.
                                    Imperceptibly, my hands reached for the pendant, I took out my phone and projected “I love you” in 100 languages onto the opposite wall by the phone.
                                </p>

                                <p>There were few people in the cafe: a couple in love and some men.
                                    One of them was rather attractive.
                                    Oh, if he had come and invited me to have a cup of coffee with him, and I would listen with a naive smile to everything he would say, because, honestly, it doesn’t really matter what the person you like can say.
                                    I came back from my dreams and gave him a look, and met his eyes – it turned that he also was staring at me and at my pendant and smiling.
                                    Enchanted, I could not help looking at him, watching the movements of his lips.
                                    The man came up to me and invited to join him, and we had more than one cup of coffee, even more than two, while he was telling me that he had never seen such a beautiful girl and such an amazing pendant and that if it was not for the pendant, he would not dare to talk to me.
                                    I listened to him and just laughed - it helped me to relax since I had not been dating for years.
                                </p>

                                <div class="wp-caption full-width">
                                    <img src="img/photo4.jpg" alt="">
                                </div>

                                <p>That was love that has changed my life, and that was the pendant that attracted it into my life.
                                    The pendant made me absolutely happy: without it, I would have never met my beloved one, never married him, and never found how it is to fall asleep and wake up next to a person you really love.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Thanks to the <a href="https://21dollarstore.com/pages/magical-pendant-landing-page"> online store 21dollarstore.com</a> where I bought the pendant.
                                    I have already recommended it to all my colleagues at work because it's so beautiful, elegant and unique that even if it doesn't help you to find love, as it happened to me, it will definitely attract someone's attention... and then, who knows how things can go on.
                                </p>
